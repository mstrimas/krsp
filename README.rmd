This package is designed to help members of the [Kluane Red Squirrel Project](http://redsquirrel.biology.ualberta.ca/) work with the squirrel database in R. It provides functions encapsulating common database queries and helper functions to aid users writing their own bespoke queries. This package requires a access to the KRSP database and is therefore only of use to members of the project.

```
